Frog Jumping Performance :frog:

Here you will find my database on frog jumping performance along with its associated metadata and the R code I used to conduct my first few analyses!

Specifically,
The "Database and Metadata" folder contains Excel files of the Frog Jumping Performance Database and associated Metadata necessary to understand the data categories, inclusion/exclusion criteria, assumptions made, etc. These can be used to conduct subsequent analyses.

The "R Working Directory" folder contains 3 subfolders, each of which contain files necessary to run the provided R code also in this repository:
- "ANOVA" contains the files necessary to duplicate my analyses of variance.
- "Performance Curves" contains the files necessary to duplicate my creations of performance curves for each of the 19 species in the database.
- "Phylogenetic Trees" contains files used to create the phylogenetic trees which will be used for future phylogenetic analyses.

The "R Codes (HTML format)" and "R Codes (qmd format)" compressed zip folders can be used, once downloaded, to view the coding and associated outputs for the ANOVAs, performance curves, and phylogenetic tree creations. Each code should be utilized with the files in its associated "R Working Directory" subfolder as described above.

Now hop to it and enjoy learning more about the wondrous world of frogs!
