Frog Jumping Performance :frog:

Here you will find my database on frog jumping performance along with its associated metadata and the R code I used to conduct my first few analyses!

Specifically,
The "Database and Metadata" folder contains Excel files of the Frog Jumping Performance Database and associated Metadata necessary to understand the data categories, inclusion/exclusion criteria, assumptions made, etc. These can be used to conduct subsequent analyses.

"Hess (2022). Temperature at which peak frog jumping performance is reached does not vary with latitude." is my first paper featuring analyses conducted using the Frog Jumping Performance Database.

The "R Working Directory" folder contains 3 subfolders, each of which contain files necessary to run the provided R code also in this repository:
- "ANOVA" contains the files necessary to duplicate my analyses of variance and phylogenetic generalized analyses of covariance. This folder should be used in conjuction with the HTML or qmd formatted R codes entitled "FrogANOVADistance" and "FrogANOVAVelocity."
- "Performance Curves" contains the files necessary to duplicate my creations of performance curves for each of the 19 species from the database used in my first paper, Hess (2022). This folder should be used in conjuction with the HTML or qmd formatted R codes entitled "FrogPerformanceCurves."
- "Phylogenetic Trees" contains files used to create the phylogenetic trees in my first paper, Hess (2022). The .nex files were imported into TreeAnnotator as described in Hess (2022) and gave the .tre files as output, which were visualized in FigTree and exported as the .jpg files.

The "R Codes (HTML format)" and "R Codes (qmd format)" compressed zip folders can be used, once downloaded, to view the coding and associated outputs for the ANOVAs, performance curves, and phylogenetic tree creations. Each code should be utilized with the files in its associated "R Working Directory" subfolder as described above.

Please feel free to leave comments, concerns, and/or edit suggestions in the "Issues" or "Projects" tab of this repository.

Now hop to it and enjoy learning more about the wondrous world of frogs!
